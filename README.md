# Getting Started with Todo App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses a typescript template.

## View This Project

This application is hosted on my website and can be viewed [here](https://tonyrizzotto.com/typescript-todo/).

### Start the Project Locally

Clone the repository with:

```
git clone https://github.com/tonyrizzotto/typescript-todo-app.git
```

Once you've successfully cloned the project, navigate over into the project directory and open up your terminal and run:

```
npm install
```

Once that is completed, run:

```
npm start
```

A window will open up in your default browser and you'll be able to use the application.

Enjoy!
